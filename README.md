# 📢 CMS-Servlet-JSP – Web-Based Complaint Management System

Welcome to **CMS-Servlet-JSP**, a web-based Complaint Management System built using **JSP**, **Servlets**, and **MySQL** following the **MVC architecture**.  
This project is a part of my academic submission for the **IJSE GDSE program**, focused on understanding how web systems handle structured data flow and user interactions without external frameworks.
